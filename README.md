Proophessor Do Symfony (short *Do*) demonstrates the power of prooph components in conjunction with Symfony.

> This is a clone of [proophessor-do](https://github.com/prooph/proophessor-do) to demonstrate the *Symfony way* with prooph components.

## Business Domain

The business logic implemented in this educational project is very simple and should be known by everybody in one way or the other.
It is about managing todo lists for users whereby a todo can have a deadline and the assigned user can add a reminder to get notified when
time has passed.

## Installation

Please refer to the [installation instructions](https://github.com/prooph/proophessor-do/docs/installation.md).

If you have problems with cache files run `sudo chmod 777 var -R`

If you run Symfony proophessor-do app in production mode, you have to compile the assets!

```php
$ docker-compose run --rm php php bin/console assetic:dump --env=prod
```

## Learning by doing!

When you play around with the application you will notice missing functionality. This has a simple reason. You explore
a learning application and what is the best way to learn? Right! **Learning by doing!** So if you want to learn something about
CQRS and Event Sourcing:

1. Pick up an open task listed below
2. Get us a note in the corresponding issue that you accept the challenge
3. Ask if you need help -> [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/prooph/improoph)
4. Have fun and learn!


*Note: Some tasks depend on others and some can be split into sub tasks. Let's discuss this in the issues. And of course you
can also work together. Sharing work doubles knowledge!*
